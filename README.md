**A summary of what you produced today.**

* Stuart and Jonathan worked on a census tracking map, and travel time prototype to assess
* They also used the Google Routing API to pull in information about travel times between service locations and hive programs. Mostly in an effort to promote events accross programs and deterine the feasibility of projects by population travel time distances
* Some of the team played around with some mapping tools, learning about CartoDB and other open source mapping resources.
* Some of the team traveled as ambassadors to other teams to learn more about how we might cross-pollinate mapping projects
